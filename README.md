PARROT: Interactive Privacy-Aware Internet of Things Application Design Tool
LICENSE: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License


The objective of this tool is to simplify the creation of privacy-aware IoT applications for developers. It provides a simple interface that allows dragging and dropping of objects, referred to as "nodes," from a diverse palette containing sensors, clouds, and other relevant components.

Code description:
The PARROT tool has been developed and implemented using Eclipse Sirius (https://eclipse.dev/sirius/), a renowned platform known for its exceptional domain-specific modelling capabilities.
In the Sirius framework, the graphical representation of the domain-specific models in PARROT is made up of both declarative and imperative specifications. The declarative section focuses on defining the appearance and layout of the graphical elements, while the imperative section specifies their dynamic behaviours and interactions.
